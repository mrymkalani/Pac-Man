Pac-Man Advanced
A modern take on the classic Pac-Man game, implemented using Python’s turtle library. The game features 5 different levels, where you need to collect dots while avoiding enemies.
Features:
Simple graphics using the turtle module.
Five levels with varying complexity.
Enemies with basic AI that chase the player.
Score and lives tracking.

Controls:
Use the arrow keys to move Pac-Man:
Up: Move up
Down: Move down
Left: Move left
Right: Move right
Press the Space key to start the game or proceed to the next level.
How the Game Works:
The game consists of 5 levels. In each level, you need to collect all the dots.
There are enemies in each level that you need to avoid. If you collide with an enemy, you lose a life.
Once all the dots in a level are collected, you move on to the next level. The game ends when you complete all the levels and a "YOU WIN" message is displayed.

Notes:
Each level has a different maze layout.
Your score increases as you collect dots.
If you lose all your lives, the game will end.
